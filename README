Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i(0-indexed), write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

For example, given an input list of values w = [2, 8], when we pick up a number out of it, the chance is that 8 times out of 10 we should pick the number 1 as the answer since it's the second element of the array (w[1] = 8).

Given an input list of values [1, 9], when we pick up a number out of it, the chance is that 9 times out of 10 we should pick the number 9 as the answer.

In other words, the probability that a number got picked is proportional to the value of the number, with regards to the total sum of all numbers.
